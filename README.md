social-self-hack (SSH)
================

We all understand that there are aspects of
ourselves that are not imediatelly observable.
One of these aspects is our social being. Tied
to instincts, traumas and underlying aspects of our
minds, we cannot access them directly.

This repo is dedicated to ease access to our social
self, both for understanding of our inner (social) structures
and for making use of these structures.

Core features of this instance is:

*) Directions and tools to obtain, understand and use selfdata to various purposes, from self-knowledge and research to activism and marketing.

*) Directions and tools to integrate your data to the Linked Open Data Gigant Global Graph, contributing to and with the benefit of its human legacy.

*) Directions for self-transparency: open your data and your processes, attesting dedication and sharing ongoing work, easing collaborative processes and friends to help with ideas or direct labour.

*) Directions and tools to the creation of multimedia art with selfdata (sounds, music, images, video).

*) Directions to hack this open source bit. It is a requirement that it starts running with one command: $ meteor
:-)

Everyone is encouraged to have a selfhack instance. As such, this instance has documents of my interests for selfhacks. 

Well, just start with:

 $ git clone xxx
 $ cd social-self-hack
 $ meteor

and hack on and enjoy.

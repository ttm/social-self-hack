social-self-hack (SSH)
================

We all understand that there are aspects of
ourselves that are not imediatelly observable.
One of these aspects is our social being. Tied
to instincts, traumas and underlying aspects of our
minds, we cannot access them directly.

This repo is dedicated to ease access to our social
self, both for understanding of our inner (social) structures
and for making use of these structures.
